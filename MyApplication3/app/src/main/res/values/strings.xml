    <string name="mockingbird_description">Yeah, I know sometimes Things may not always make sense to you right now But hey, whatd daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier Stiffen up that upper lip What you cryin about? You got me Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad When Im gone, but Im tryna give you the life that I never had I can see youre sad even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside, you wanna cry Cause youre scared, I aint there? Daddys with you in your prayers No more crying, wipe them tears, daddys here, no more nightmares We gon pull together through it, we gon do it Lainie, uncles crazy, aint he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it Were all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls Lookin puzzled, in a daze, I know its confusing you Daddys always on the move, mamas always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow, it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growin up as daddy that he had to see Daddy dont want you to see, but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have got so bad between us I dont see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when we was teenagers But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But its just something we have no control over, and thats what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day, well wake up, and this will all just be a dream Now hush, little baby, dont you cry Everythings gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddys here to hold ya through the night I know mommys not here right now, and we dont know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise mamas gon be alright Huh, its funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree And said some of em were from me, cause daddy couldnt buy em Ill never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying Cause daddy felt like a bum, see, daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time, every house that we lived in Either kept gettin broken into and robbed Or shot up on the block And your mom was savin money for you in a jar Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mamas heart And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart Mom and dad was arguin a lot So mama moved back on to Chalmers in a flat one-bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And thats when daddy went to California with his CD And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and mama out to see me But daddy had to work, you and mama had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the TV, and mama didnt like it And you and Lainie were too young to understand it Papa was a rolling stone, mama developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first-hand Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now Im sittin in this empty house Just reminiscin, lookin at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, its almost like youre sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddys still here Lainie, Im talkin to you too, daddys still here I like the sound of that, yeah, its got a ring to it, dont it? Shh, mamas only gone for the moment Now hush, little baby, dont you cry Everythings gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddys here to hold ya through the night I know mommys not here right now, and we dont know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise mamas gon be alright And if you ask me to, daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird Ima give you the world Ima buy a diamond ring for you, Ima sing for you Ill do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird dont sing, and that ring dont shine Ima break that birdies neck Ill go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat, dont fuck with dad.</string>
